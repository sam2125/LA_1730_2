				The media played many important roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. At first, people were very anxious about this new viral disease and there was only very little knowledge for people, of this disease. The media was the only source for them to get any new information, mainly TVs. As the number of cases was increasing each day, people began to panic. These TV news channels announce the number of cases of that day and all. The use of newspapers has declined significantly because there were doubts among people the COVID will spread through it. So TV was the main source to get COVID-related news. During the lockdown days, all of the schools and offices were closed, People can't go out. The main ways for them to get away from their boredom are these TVs and other social media. People began liking the shows that they had never seen before or had never tried before. People become addicted some people become lazy.

				These media also became very crucial that any false news they publish will create a big issue. Each and every news they say should be very careful, there was much fake news propagating among people. These television media helped people to get educated about COVID-related things. They showed the importance of personal hygiene, use of sanitizers, washing hands with soaps, and mainly the use of masks.  The news channels began covering the shortage of masks and sanitizers, which helped people to purchase them before they are depleted, and also created panic among people. When our country announced a complete lockdown, daily wages worker's life became very harsh. They are hardly able to find a way to earn for their family. Some media channels point to this issue, which helped them in many ways. There were many migrant workers who travel between states and reach their homes. This has caused the spread of the virus from them to others. But there were some media coverages who show them as a bad face to society and also there were some coverages who showed all the difficulties they faced.

				One crucial thing that makes use of televisions is the education system. When the lockdown came, classes became online and there were many students who could not afford mobile phones or tablets to watch online classes, also there were remote villages with no/poor internet connection. So the government started the coverage of lectures with correct schedules through TVs.
