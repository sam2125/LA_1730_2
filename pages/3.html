					The covid lockdown forced everyone to work from home, leading to people and the government investing a ton of money in internet infrastructure. So This leads to an increase in the number of internet users throughout the country. These billions of new internet users started flowing towards platforms like Instagram reels and TikTok for entertainment. We saw a considerable rise in the number of Instagram celebrities during the time of lockdown. The primary reason for that was this rise in the audience due to covid 19 lockdown. Cooking, dancing, and music were the primary types of most popular content on these platforms. The primary reason for the rise of music and dance was the sudden disruption in live events and concerts, so singers' musician's dancers were forced to perform through these media. But these media were open anyone could show their talent through these media irrespective of their fame so apart from these celebrities many ordinary people also got an opportunity to show their talent. These social media platforms also started paying creators, which motivated them even more. In short, lockdown actually made the playing field level.
