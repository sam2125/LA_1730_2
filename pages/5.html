					Due to covid-19 internet and other medias widely used for educational purpose. Distance education was a less known method in India. But due to the covid pandemic we got more exposure to the possibilities of conducting classes online. This also gave students the opportunity to  study more than just the academics. Lots of student started to explore the online educational services to learn new things as well as develop new useful skills. Also, several welfare societies across the country took the initiative to donate digital devices such as smartphones and laptops. Even though their intention was to make sure everyone got the  opportunity for proper education, this also helped financially backward families to get some exposure to the internet and information technology. This helped to make their lives better.
