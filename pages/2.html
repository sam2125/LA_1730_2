                            <p>
                                Digitalization accross the world is the main reason behind the increased consumption of media so the OTT.
                                But the covid-19 acted as a catalyst to it.
                                According to the recent reports, india is showing a greater incrememnt in the use of OTT platforms during 
                                the pandemic period which in turn make them concentrate more on indians.
                                Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) predicted in 2019 that 30â€“35 million 
                                OTT subscribers will be in India by 2021,
                                But it turns out to be around 70M at the end of 2021.This is the huge rise and which happend because the 
                                pandemic forced the producers to look for other alternatives to release thier work.Not only the netflix,
                                but there are several other 
                                platforms too like Amazone prime,Zee5,hotsar etc  and there are lots of emerging platforms too due the increased usage.
                                Nowdats these platforms are competing each other by claiming new releases.

                            <p>
                                Anyone who is tested positive need to be self-isolated for a period of month at the earlier stage 
                                of covid but it got reduced to 14 days later.During the quarentine period we are all alone without 
                                family and sometime we are having nothing do.And this is the main reason pushing our mind toward the 
                                OTT platforms and they treated this situation well to make a good business.Since the theatres are 
                                closed to reduce the contact between people ,OTT platforms became popular in releasing new movies and 
                                series and even television shows.Producers were also happy in releasing movies throgh this platforms since 
                                they are getting one time payment for their work which is in turn reducing mental stress.All these happened 
                                after the pandemic came into the picture and people started thinking on alternatives to release movies and shows.
                                OTT platforms have a greater role in spending time with family in their in private place.
